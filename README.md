# AI Powered Fitness Coach with Personalized Workouts
Generative AI-based fitness web app that delivers personalized workout plans and AI coaching—at zero cost. It leverages the power of OpenAI, LangChain, and Streamlit to build an interactive, intelligent platform tailored to each user’s needs.

## Problem Statement

Many people struggle to stay fit because they don’t have a personal trainer or a workout plan that fits their needs. Hiring a coach is expensive, and most online workout plans are too general.

This project, AI-Powered Fitness Coach, solves this problem by using AI (OpenAI), Python, Streamlit, and LangChain to:
- Create personalized workout plans based on user details (age, weight, fitness level, goals).
- Provide AI-powered coaching with real-time advice and fitness tips.
- Let users chat with an AI fitness coach to ask workout-related questions.
- Offer a simple, interactive web app (built with Streamlit) for easy access.

With this project, anyone can get a custom fitness plan and coaching for free using AI!
